A fork of the SCUBA project begun at Stanford to help allow non-admin users to choose to boot into Windows on a dual-boot macintosh. A full setup would require a method of making this choice on the Windows side as well, but that portion has not been open-sourced as of yet.

For the moment this can be thought of as a direct replacement for Apple's [BootPicker](http://www.apple.com/education/it-professionals/bootpicker/), and is functional as such.

At the moment the only part that has changed was to bring it to Google Code, as the old home has been erased.
